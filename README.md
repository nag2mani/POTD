This repository contains a collection of Problems, Algorithms, and notes aimed at enhancing problem-solving and coding skills. The goal is to solve at least one question every day and continually add new solutions and insights.

## Repository Files

- **Algorithms**  
  - _Added Sorting Algorithms_ (1 hour ago)  
  This folder contains various sorting algorithms implemented in Python, including but not limited to:
    - Bubble Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Insertion Sort
  
- **Leetcode**  
  - _Added Roadmap_ (2 days ago)  
  This folder focuses on solving Leetcode questions and contains a roadmap for improving coding skills and mastering algorithmic challenges. The roadmap provides a structured approach to tackling problems.

- **Notes**  
  - _Added Roadmap_ (2 days ago)  
  A collection of notes and learning materials aimed at reinforcing concepts related to algorithms, data structures, and Python programming. The roadmap is also included for guided learning.

- **Puzzle**  
  - _Done_ (4 months ago)  
  The `Puzzle` folder contains fun and engaging puzzles solved using Python. These are meant to challenge logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

- **README.md**  
  - _13th January Started_ (7 months ago)  
  The README file (this file) provides an overview of the repository and its structure, along with a navigation guide for exploring its contents.

- **manage.py**  
  - _13th January Started_ (7 months ago)  
  This script is a Django management tool. Although primarily focused on algorithmic solutions, parts of this repository may include web-based projects.

## Goals
- Solve at least one coding problem per day.
- Continuously update the repository with new algorithms, solutions, and notes.
- Provide a comprehensive learning experience with a structured roadmap.
