@cache ; It will reduce your run time put this after class solution.
[] is False; You can use it in if condition when use stack.
Maximum diffrence of a sorted array is diffrence between first and last element.(not much good ?)

In Python, the or operator returns the first operand if it is true, and the second operand otherwise. If both operands are true, it returns the first operand.
example;
list1 = []
list2 = [1, 5, 9]
result = list1 or list2
It will return list2 because it is not false.

floor = 3//2
ceil = -(-3//2)

The total number of subarrays in an array of size N is N * (N + 1) / 2
